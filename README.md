## Purpose of Project
This website was modified to meet accessibility standards and ensure visually impaired visitors were able to experience and enjoy all elements of the site.  

## Actions Performed
To meet these standards, semantic tags were added to all sections necessary.  "Alt" tags were also assigned to each image, adding readable properties describing those images.  This applied readable text to all of the photos and images used.  When the visitor chooses to read the page by speaking text, all images will also have their properties read.

## Technologies Used
Project was created with:
* HTML & CSS files
* Using VS Code

## Summary
The Web Accessibility project provided me with experience creating tags that make websites completely readable  - applying this to both the words and the images. Visually impaired visitors are a priority for this client, so making their website accesible was their main concern.  Thankfully, this was able to be achieved.

## Minimum Run Requirements
This project can be deployed from any web browser.
